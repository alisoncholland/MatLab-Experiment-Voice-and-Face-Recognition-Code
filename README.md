# Installation

## You should have a running version of MatLab installed on your PC/Mac. 
## You'll also need to download the Cogent package, which you can find here: http://www.vislab.ucl.ac.uk/cogent.php
## I'd recommend downloading both the Cogent Graphics toolbox and Cogent 2000 software.

# Usage

## Feel free to use whatever code you like. All I kindly ask in return is that you cite it appropriately :)
